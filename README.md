# phase1-projectartistsAtMetApp

An app to show art and artists at the Metroploitan Museum of Art in the form of a single page application.

I will utilize the Metropolitan Museum of Art API (all rights reserved to respective owners of artworks) in form of a db.json file as my database.
The MET also provides a csv file which may be used in conjunction with this app, will decide as app progresses.
The artists will be displayed with artwork and mouseover each to place into the showcase area of the page.
If you wish to delete an image simply press the delete button. If you wish to add images to the database input the link in the image file placeholder.

The app should also include several eventlisteners such as click, submit, and mouseover. Once one clicks or passes over an image to select or delete said image.

In addition my first blog that helped me figure out some of the aspects of the first project https://medium.com/@ianscottmartin/my-javascript-journey-9b3bf8423870.
